howto:

probably fix up your path to make sure it's using the right "port..." first...

add
file:///Users/rogerdpack/dev/mplayer-svn/mplayer_patches/port_dir
to
/opt/rdp_project_local/etc/macports/sources.conf
# ref: http://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories

$ portindex # doesn't need sudo ?

this package basically collides with the standard mplayer package, I guess [without any way around that?] 
so you cannot install this and any other mplayer port at the same time

$ export PATH=/opt/rdp_project_local/bin:$PATH
$ sudo port  install mplayer-edl # add -kd for extra debug, add -f if it complains of "already activated files" for dependencies when you do this
$ sudo port mdmg rdp-projects 

# and distribute to https://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayer-edl/files/mac-dependencies/

# to build macports initially: ./configure --prefix=/opt/rdp_project_local --with-applications-dir=/Applications/rdp_projects
# then run port sync
